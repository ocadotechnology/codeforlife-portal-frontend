      Many features of Code for Life require you to register as a User. Access
      to certain resources will be restricted from non-registered Users and
      Users who are not part of a participating school. Parents, guardians or
      carers of students registered through their school or club, should contact
      the child’s teacher directly to request copies of the teaching resources,
      to assist with homework or progression in learning how to program.
      Teachers should provide a valid and professional email address when
      registering on the Code for Life site.
    </Typography>
    <Typography>
      If you register a school or club, you will automatically become the
      responsible ‘Administrator’. You should provide a valid and professional
      email address when registering as a teacher. If you create a school on the
      Code for Life site, you, by default become an ‘Administrator’ for your
      school.
    </Typography>
    <Typography fontWeight="bold">
      As an Administrator, you warrant that:
    </Typography>
    <ItemizedList styleType="disc">
      <ListItemText>
        you are responsible and accountable for ensuring the online safety of
        the school or club for whom you are acting and that only legitimate
        institutional addresses should be accepted at sign up;
      </ListItemText>
      <ListItemText>
        all registration information you submit is accurate, complete and
        truthful;
      </ListItemText>
      <ListItemText>
        you will maintain the accuracy of such information; and

      The organisation Administrator is able to make other teachers in the
      organisation Administrators.
    </Typography>
    <Typography fontWeight="bold">
      All Administrators should be aware that:
    </Typography>
    <ItemizedList styleType="disc">
      <ListItemText>
        they are able to access all the classes, and the students of those
        classes, within the organisation. This also includes the students’
        progress data, as well as any custom level created by colleagues or
        students within the organisation.
      </ListItemText>
      <ListItemText>
        they are able to manage (create, edit, transfer and remove) all the
        classes, students and levels within the organisation; and
      </ListItemText>
      <ListItemText>
        if there is only one Administrator in the organisation and that
        Administrator deletes their account, the Administrator role will
        automatically be transferred to the next Teacher in the organisation.
      </ListItemText>
    </ItemizedList>
    <Typography>
      As a User, you further warrant that you will only grant access codes to
      teachers, staff members and students who are current employees or students
      known to your school or club. Upon termination of a teacher or other staff
      member’s employment with you, you will ensure they assign over all
      existing classes and/or students to another teacher within your school or
      club. If at any time you become aware of a User who falsely claims to be
      affiliated with your school or club, you are obliged to notify the Code
      for Life team immediately.

      A Code for Life User must not choose a username or institution name that
      could potentially infringe anyone’s rights, which is intended to confuse,
      or which is offensive, hurtful or otherwise inappropriate, as reasonably
      determined by us. We reserve the right to change a username if we think it
      offends the Terms & Conditions. Users who are provided with login
      information for Code for Life by your teacher, parent, guardian or carer,
      are “Students”. Students are divided between those who are registered by a
      teacher through a school or club, or set up as an independent student
      using a parent, guardian, or carer email address.
