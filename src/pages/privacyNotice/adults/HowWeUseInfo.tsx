        perform our agreement with you and provide you with our services. For

        our learning materials. Having an account gives teachers access to
        course material, class and individual student management features, and
        also it gives students access to the portal in order to learn how to
        code within a supported environment (classroom), or independently (at

            ensure that our portal is secure and is used in accordance with our
            Terms. For example, we may use account information to limit a user
            temporarily or permanently from the Code for Life portal if that
            user engages in inappropriate use of the site (e.g. giving other
            people access to their user account, malicious misuse of the portal,
            including spam).

            send you important information: for example, we use your email
            address to send you account verification emails, emails to notify
            you about changes to our Terms, or about any maintenance impacting
            your access to the portal. Sometimes, we may be required by law to
            send you this information.

            provide customer support and respond to your queries, for example,

            disclose personal information (other than name and email address)
            when contacting us – messages you exchange on the portal and any
            forms you submit to us will be recorded. The Contact Us form is
            strictly for the purpose of user support. User-initiated
            communication concerning topics other than those relating directly
            to the Code for Life portal, including resources or user experience,
            may not be answered. Please be aware that we will never ask for
            personal information other than what is required to identify your
            account and respond to your queries, and we will never ask for your
