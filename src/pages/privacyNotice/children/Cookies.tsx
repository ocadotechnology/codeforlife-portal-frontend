    <Typography>
      Cookies are tiny files that have information (data) in them. When you
      visit our site, we may put some cookies on the device you use. Cookies
      allow us to remember things like when you visit our site. They help us
      understand how you are using the Code for Life portal, as well as which
      parts of our portal are popular and which ones we need to make better.

    <Typography>
      We also make use of things called “web beacons” or “pixels.” These are
      similar to cookies and allow us to keep an eye on how well our website is
      working and look for ways to improve it. To keep things simple, when we
      talk about cookies in this Privacy Notice, we also mean web beacons and
      pixels.

                These cookies help us understand how you use our site, so we can
                improve the service we provide. This can be anything like which
                pages you go to most often and if you get error messages from
                web pages. They allow us to measure how visitors use the portal
                (for example which parts of the website are clicked on and the

      We work with other companies to run the analytics cookies on our portal,
      including Google, who provides our Google Analytics cookie, and Mouseflow.
      They might also collect information from websites that are not ours. We

      used. We do not let other companies show ads on our portal.

      <strong>Google Analytics.</strong> We use Google Analytics (which is run
      by Google) to help us understand how you use our site. The information it
      collects about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be
      stored by Google in the United States. Google may pass this information to
      other organisations who help them to interpret this information. They may
      also pass the information to other organisations if the law says they have
      to do so. If you choose to allow analytics / performance cookies on our
      site, you are consenting to Google using your data for the reasons above.

      <strong>Mouseflow.</strong> We also use Mouseflow to help us understand
      how our site is used and which areas are mostly used. It uses cookies to
      record information such as when you click on or move your mouse, when you
      scroll or press a key, what pages you visit on our website, how much time
      you spend on each page, and also information about the device you use
      (like the device type (desktop/tablet/phone), location (city/country) and
      language). Mouseflow does not collect any information on pages where it is
      not installed and does not track or collect information outside your web
      browser.
