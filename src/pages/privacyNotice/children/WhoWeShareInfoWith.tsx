      For example, we share your name and email address details with DotDigital,
      a company that sends emails to users on our behalf (such as when we want
      to collect your feedback or need to give you important email updates about
      our service). This data sharing also allows us to view when your emails
      have been opened.

      Another company we share personal data with is Freshdesk. They help us
      keep track of the questions users send using the Contact Us form, so we
      can reply to them more quickly.

      We also use a survey company called UsabilityHub to help us carry out
      surveys. UsabilityHub records time spent on the site, country, device
      type, device platform alongside any questions that we may ask you in our
      surveys (for example, the survey may ask your age). You can find out more
      about UsabilityHub&nbsp;

      Finally, we may need to share your information for legal reasons, such as
      if we sold our business to another company, if our business advisors
      needed the information to help us achieve the purposes in this Privacy
      Notice, or to respond to law enforcement or court requests if there is a
      legal problem.
