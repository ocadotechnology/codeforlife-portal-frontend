            We are open source, so anyone can ask to contribute. You can play
            with game-running JavaScript, Python/Django, animation using SVG and
            Raphael, and a lot more. We&apos;d like input from all sorts of
            backgrounds, whether you&apos;re: a programmer looking for a
            creative outlet; a teacher hoping to shape the resources; or even a
            pupil putting your skills to the test.
