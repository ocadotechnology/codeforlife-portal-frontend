            Sharon was instrumental in helping to create Code for Life. At the
            beginning of 2014 she was recruited to act as our Educational
            Consultant. The project drew on her previous skills as a pioneering
            computing teacher and education consultant.

            Sharon has left a lasting legacy by creating something which will
