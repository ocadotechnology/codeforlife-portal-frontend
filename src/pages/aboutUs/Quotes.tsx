            We were delighted computing entered the UK curriculum in 2014.
            However, many teachers felt unprepared. And the lack of diversity in
            people studying STEM concerned us. So, we sought to make the subject
            appeal to a broader group of both students and teachers.
          </Quote>
          <Typography mb={0}>

            Group.

            With that in mind, CFL was developed by volunteers and interns from
            Ocado Technology - the technology arm of Ocado Group - and teacher
            Sharon Harrison, who created the Rapid Router learning materials.
            Anne Marie continues:

            I&apos;m proud this initiative has been breaking down stereotypes.
            Children are seeing that you don&apos;t have to fit a certain
            gender, race or personality type to get coding.

            Today, CFL is operated by a small core team and volunteers.
